     <p>You are a orange rectangle. To control him you use the arrow keys(the buttons that apear on mobile).</p>
<p>There are 3 types of enemys green, yellow and red. At the end of the game there is a boss that takes 10 hits to kill.</p>
<p>To kill enemys you need to jump on the enemys heads. To beat a screen you need to kill all enemys on it.</p>
<p>At the end of a level you will see a green wall at the end at the end of the screen. That is how you play the game.</p>
